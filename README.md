# YOLO Module to detect people in images

## Description
This module uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect people in images. The YOLO algorithm is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The module uses the pre-trained YOLO model to detect people in images. The module can be used to detect people in images and return the bounding box coordinates of the detected people. This is a useful module for applications that require real-time object detection, such as surveillance systems, security systems, and autonomous vehicles.

## Usage
To use the module, you need to install dependencies from the requirements.txt file. You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
