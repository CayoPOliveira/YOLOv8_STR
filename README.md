# YOLO Module to detect people in images

## Description
This module uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect people in images. The YOLO algorithm is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The module uses the pre-trained YOLO model to detect people in images. The module can be used to detect people in images and return the bounding box coordinates of the detected people. This is a useful module for applications that require real-time object detection, such as surveillance systems, security systems, and autonomous vehicles.

## Install and training of YOLO
To install YOLO, you can follow the instructions on the official YOLO website: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/. The YOLO website provides detailed instructions on how to install YOLO on your system. You can also download pre-trained YOLO models from the YOLO website. The pre-trained YOLO models are trained on the COCO dataset, which contains images of 80 different object categories, including people.

I made a notebook to train YOLO on custom dataset. You can find it [here](./yolo11_invader_detect.ipynb). I trained using the Google Colab platform and downloaded the weights file.
